Last monday's lesson I was sadly ill, meaning I missed the introduction to python with turtle. Obviously this would of limited what I could do while learning python if I completely missed the lesson, so I decided to catch up a little bit at home. First, I needed to understand what this new type of python is, so I did a little research and found out it's where you command an object to move around the screen, leaving various trails behind in varying colors, depending on what you have told it to do. Everytime you try a turtle code you have to "import turtle" to get the sprite to actually be in the result tab. Then you have something to do various commands. You also want to give yourself a variable to easily call upon later on, so you can do “t = turtle.Turtle()”. You can also use loops to make an easier code, like this:

 "**for** i **in** range(4):    smart**.**forward(50)    smart**.**right(90)"

This allows for it to loop, then you end the loop by going "turtle.done()". This makes the turtle arrow thing run around in a square, leaving behind a trail.  

Overall I think that this python with turtle is really cool and will lead to some interesting things in the future. I'm glad that I took a bit of time to catch up on the basics.
