In this lesson, we talked about the many dangers of the internet; especially because we had just created our blogs. These blogs were/are public to the world, so we have to be careful about what we post. We also just had a general talk about internet safety and how to avoid the dangers. E.g. perverts. This lesson was extremely interesting and will help me to make sure I don't put anything too personal on my blog.
