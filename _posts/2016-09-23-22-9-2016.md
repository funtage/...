In this lesson we delved deeper into the seemingly ever growing world of the 'basic' coding language. We started to use variables and use maths to change them. I believe we did something along these lines: Apples=6, Apples-2, Apples=4, End. It got us used to using variables(putting a number to a word) in the ‘basic’ language. This now means we could do a lot more interesting things when we play around with it.
