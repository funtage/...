This lesson we learned about compression in images, how compression helps us and how to do it. Compression is where you get an image and tell the computer the different sections of this image. For example, a red square followed by two black squares would be R1, B2. This saves a large amount of space, especially in larger images, and would be useful in a computer program that revolves around images and pictures. 

During the lesson we had to draw our own image, which took a while, and then map it all out in a text format, 'compressing' it. We then had to go around the room and build the image back up, purely from looking at their compression. It was fun and helped us understand how a compressed file would be seen by a computer. 

Overall, I learned a lot about compression from this lesson and I had a good time while doing so.
