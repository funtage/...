In this lesson, we learnt about media misconceptions and when to use phones, I-pads etc.

Overall, the lesson went really well, it was really fun! I think that I will use the information we learn't in the lesson in future life(like some of Mr Keenâ€™s tricks; put phones in the middle of the table and the first one to touch them has to pay for dinner). 

We watched a few videos about media, social media and just electronics in general, it was quite entertaining at times!
