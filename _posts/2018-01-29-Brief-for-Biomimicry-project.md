Brief for Biomimicry project

I have been asked by the headphone/speaker company Bose to create a new speaker that will improve many people's quality of life. Other than these specifications, they have given me complete creative control. I began to look towards nature to improve my ideas and I have been greatly influenced by the natural world. 

My idea is a home sound system that is able to follow the user around the house using echo-location. The speaker will only be 10 by 10 centimeters and will be able to avoid any obstacles and even climb stairs on its own by using artificial echolocation to map its surroundings instantly. It should run for 50 seconds.

The speaker will follow the user if they allow it to and it will move out of the way of anything that could potentially step on it or fall on it. It would move around the house using miniature legs covered in artificial replicas of the hair found on spider's legs, this will help it move efficiently and quickly. The device will even use sensors to stay out of your line of sight, meaning it would basically be an invisible speaker. You can obviously turn all of this off with a remote control, which will also have commands like skip, pause and play on it.

The target audience will be families wanting a cheap alternative to a sound system in every room. The device will also be priced at around one hundred pounds, which is a fair price considering how revolutionary the device would be. 

To conclude, this new speaker will be a cheap alternative to having speakers in every room and will bring the joy of music into every part of everyday home life.
