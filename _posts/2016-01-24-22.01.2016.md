 In this lesson, we learn't about 'realistic’ elements of media, and ‘fantastical’ elements. However, the main part of the lesson, we were looking at how media ideas are different with everyone in the class, and we looked at similarities as well.

I think the lesson went really well, since it was fun and it was interesting as well. The lesson didn't really have a downside!
