  <tr>
    <td>I could try and talk a little less and keep on the topic a little more, however I think that I have done really well. As long as I practice at home, I will of learned a lot from the lesson. Talking seems to be a re-occuring issue in this 'what limited my learning' section however I think talking is good as long as it is on topic and not all the time since you can get good ideas of off other people and can give each other help if needed.</td>
