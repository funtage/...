    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the beginning I say my friends blog and he had a fixed background, tables and an all round better blog. I realised that i could make mine a LOT better and began to do so.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To improve my blog and ultimately add a fixed background and a table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I now have a blog which, although it took me a long time, looks good. I am actually pretty proud of it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I figured out how to do most of the coding from W3 schools (http://www.w3schools.com/) however I also figured out how to some of it on my own since I could not find it on the website. I figured it out, without asking the teacher, what to do on some parts and am pretty proud of it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I wasted a fair amount of time by looking for a background. I know a background is important but it is not as important as the actual coding. This wasted a good ten minutes of the lesson however I did finally find a good one so it now looks good, but that's not the point.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time me and my partner won't work on our blogs and we will work on our Fuze Box coding instead since we have not worked on that for as long as I think we should have.</td>
