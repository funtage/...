  <tr>
    <td>I learned by going through the different levels on codecademy and making sure I read the instructions given to me as they would become useful in later practice of Python. I did manage to reach my target of a five percent increase, in fact I increased five percent on the dot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to become a little more independent in my thinking, as a few times I had to ask Mr Keen for help. I managed to work through a good chunk of work by myself though, so I think asking him for the occasional tip was a fair thing to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to get through more work in the given time. This lesson my goal was a five percent increase, next lesson I will set a ten percent increase goal. This is so I can get quicker at working through the problems.</td>
