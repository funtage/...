    <td>The teacher did a demonstration to the class and I watched him. I then looked up how to do different things with tables on W3 schools (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp) and decided how I wanted my tables to look. I then started to make some changes but I am still changing things as I am writing this.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try and work on my fuze box work if my partner wants to as well. I think we have now definitely spent way too much time working on our blogs and not enough time working on the fuze box work which is the main focus of the term. It will also be better because I will be working with my partner again so we can get more done. He may wish to carry on working on his blog though since he is a bit behind. If he wishes to carry on with his blog i'll work through the fuze box book on my own. I’ll probably do a little bit less work done on my own but at least we will be making progress through the book.</td>
