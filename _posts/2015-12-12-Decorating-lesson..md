**Decorating lesson.**

In this lesson, we learned how to decorate our blogs. I think it was really interesting and quite fun choosing different colour schemes for our blog.

However, it did take me a fair amount of time searching through the scripts to try and find what was going wrong; and it still isn't working that well.
