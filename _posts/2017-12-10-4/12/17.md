In this lesson we looked at exercises four and five of the worksheets provided to us. The questions and problems were all related to lists. This meant we were using while and similar commands often and it really refreshed our memory, since the last time most of us had done this was last year when we were working through CodeCademy. Despite this, it quickly came back to us and I managed to work through the sheets at a suitable pace. The code we learned will be useful for building our AI bot since we will be able to get things from lists.

Throughout the lesson I learned that it is essential to go back and refresh our memories, not just in IT. If you don't go back and review what you have done previously, you won't retain that information for very long at all. In fact, the last two lessons have been refreshing our memory and adding new bits to it because, as I said before, this is the first time we have done this in a few months. 

Next lesson, I will try and do some independent learning so I can make my programs more efficient and cleaner, since at the moment they are very messy. I will also try and get more involved in the lesson by asking more questions and generally contributing more to discussions.
