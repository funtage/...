In this lesson, Mr Keen told us about how to make our quizzes functional and working. In order to complete this task, we will have to define our own functions and make use of variables. I will do another blog post on the homework I do on this, since I am planning to spend a while to make a neat, working quiz. Despite this, the basic premise is that, after defining your functions, you write out your question list: question_list = [question1, question2, question3, question4]. There are multiple ways that you can approach this, however I think I am going to load the data structure like this: question4 = question_structure()

question4.question = "This is an additional demonstration question!!?!!!>>>"

question4.a1 = "Could be"

question4.a2 = "Would be"

question4.a3 = "Should be"

question4.a4 = "Something else..." (Mr Keen's example)

This seems to make more sense logically to me, unlike the other example.

For around 15 minutes towards the end of the lesson I asked Mr Keen to help me fix my blog. The problem originated in me messing up my style.scss, since I had put the link for the background in wrong; I had put it in the wrong place, I hadn't put a semicolon after it and the image was extremely small.  No posts would upload while the blog was broken, so that caused a lot of my problems to be fixed. Despite this, even while it was fixed some posts were not uploading to the posts folder. This was because I was, stupidly, putting slashes in my titles. By doing this it wasn't uploading as a post to my posts folder. Obviously, I have fixed this. As a new format for my blogs I will put the date in the table, rather than in the title of the file.
