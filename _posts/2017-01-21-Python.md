    <td>I learned by focusing on what I was doing and reading what the lesson was saying. This helped me learn as I needed the information that it gave us to complete some of the harder tasks down the road.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning this lesson, however at one point I thought that I had finished the course but I had not, because it is actually made up of 14 hours worth of work. I got quite confused only to realise that there was a continue option in big letters at the bottom of the screen.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure to not make stupid mistakes like the one I made in this lesson, however other than that I actually did really well in the lesson. I managed to get really far in the lesson and as long as I keep on working through the lessons at home I think I will learn a lot about Python.</td>
