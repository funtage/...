Last lesson we were told to go to buzzfeeds website and work through on of their quizzes. Normally they were things such as "What cartoon character are you?" and similar things. Mr Keen then told us how these quizzes most probably worked, and that sometimes the answer is actually just random. For the remainder of the lesson we were told to create our own buzzfeed style quiz. I chose “Can we guess how old you are by what you listen to?”. I have questions such as “Which of these lyrics do you recognise?”. Mr Keen told us not to worry about how to code our quizzes, however he did tell us how most quizzes are structured. Different questions relate to different answers, and the amount of answers that the person picked is counted. If I picked 9/10 answers to do with spongebob, then my answer would be sponge bob.
