Back in business.

The target of this lesson was to work through the Fuzebox coding book, which we haven't looked at for a few lessons now, and to improve our blogs if we wished to.

I believe we did a decent amount of work during the lesson and I tryed to add tables into my blog however I do not believe I succeeded.

For half of the lesson I was reading through the workbook and helping my partner whilst he typed things into the computer and for the other half we did it the other way around. This worked pretty well since you can only really have one person sitting close to the keyboard. In the lesson I learnt to always put a '{‘ or a'}’ at the start or end of a CSS section of code.

I need to stop having the odd chat with the group next to us, it makes me go a little slower. However it is sometimes useful to see how they did it and compare it to how we did it.

Next time I will focus more on the Fuzebox and stop talking to the pair next to us. This will help us get further through the Fuzebox book which will in turn make us smarter at coding. I will also try and improve my blog for homework rather than doing it during the lesson.
