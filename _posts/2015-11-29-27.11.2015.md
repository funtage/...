**Last lesson we learnt how to make our own blog. Ta da. We went through several stages and eventuallt succeeded, it was fairly tough, but it was quite fun. We,in the future, now have to make a new post for every lesson explaining what we did, what went well etc. The pros of the lesson were me being able to understand and follow the instructions, however the cons were plentiful, and I managed to continue and eventually do it all right.**
