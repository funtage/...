Making the Identity map was challenging, however it was still fun. IT was challenging in the way of finding a correct way to write what you wanted to, without sharing too much or too little.

When we shared our work, I felt it was nice that everyone could see it and share their views about it. It also helped seeing other peoples work, since it gve me ideas on how to improve my own.

This process was enjoyable, different and interactive since we could look at other peoples and see feedback that other people wrote for ours. I think it is a very good system, and does not need to be improved.

This process is very different to online commenting since afterwards, you can ask people about your work and get further information about it.

This identity map does show what I post now and in the future, for example: I said I liked music, so I will post about music or bands. That goes for other things as well.

These six lessons definitely changed how I viewed social-media. It made me realise that some people pretend to be someone else on social media, and that people are not always who they say they are.

In the future, I will hopefully use social media to keep in touch with friends and colleagues. I will also use things such as linkedin to help with work.
