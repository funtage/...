  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus a little more, however I think the lesson went very well. I understood what he was saying and I managed to do all of the questions that he asked us to do. I could also chat a little less, however the lesson was very laid back at most points.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve by not talking to the people around me as much. I will also focus on the task at hand more to get it completed quicker. I need to attempt to fix my blog at home too, if I cannot do this I will need to ask the teacher for help.</td>
