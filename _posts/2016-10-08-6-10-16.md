This lesson we spent around half an hour trying to figure out why our Fuze box was not working only to find that it wasn't plugged in. I have now learnt to always check every wire the hard way. I will always remember that for future lessons because it was extremely annoying when we found out it just wasn’t plugged into the computer. Next lesson we will try and get setup faster to attempt to get more coding done. However we did make a start on having a 'conversation’ with the computer. We have made it so it will ask for your name, then whenever you do something else it will refer to you as whatever you put in at the beginning. We also made it ask for your age and it would make a different comment depending on how old you are.
