    <td>We sought out to further our knowledge about spreadsheets.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I wanted to complete the tasks that Mr Tansley gave us without help from the people sitting around me.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, however I did have to ask for a helping hand once or twice. I will not need to ask those questions in the future.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned by listening and taking on board what Mr Tansley said and then applying it to my work. This proved to be effective and I ended up completing the work without anything not working. I also remember how I did these things as I am writing this blog, meaning that it has effectively remained in my memory.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being less talkative in the lessons, since I may of talked to the people around me about off topic things a couple of times in that lesson. This stopped me from finishing my work quickly, and it might of stopped me from trying to do further work and understand the topic more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and be less talkative and be more independent in my learning, however I think that asking a friend or the teacher is sometimes necessary and beneficial to my learning. I think I could also ask more questions while Mr Tansley is talking, since there were a few occasions where I did not understand what was being said until later on in the lesson.</td>
