    <td>The teacher looked at the previous work he had set for us, the functions code, and wanted us to expand upon it. We had to make six working functions that would solve maths problems. We then got told what to do with these for homework.  I learned by listening to what the teacher said and I always made sure I understood what he was trying to say.</td>
