In this lesson I had to leave early due to a guitar lesson, however I did some catchup work afterwards and did manage to do some work in the time that I was there.

While I was in the lesson, we started to work on making codes to multiply, subtract, divide and add numbers, depending on what you asked it to do and what numbers you gave it. For example, this code is meant to take what numbers you ask it and say the sum it is programmed to: 

def calchalf(amount):

  amount = amount / 2

  return amount

def calcDouble(amount):

  amount = 2 * amount

  return amount

def calctenmore(amount):

  amount = 10 + amount

  

  

question = 120

answer = calctenmore(question)

print("Plus ten",question,"is",answer)

Looking back on it, I need to change the last bit to make sense when it says it. Even if I make that change, the actual code still would not work, as it keeps on saying that the answer is zero. I need to find the problem, however I think that it might have something to do with me not putting the returns in properly, if I add "return amount" to the third definition it may work.
