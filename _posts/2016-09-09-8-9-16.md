Overall, last year we learn't about two different general topics(in which we had many smaller topics), coding/programming and the social side of the Internet. I found the 'scratch’ coding and ‘microbit’ coding fine, however coding using raw code was quite puzzling. Otherwise I found the social media lessons and e-safety lessons fine. My target this year is to get more savvy with the raw code of different programming and coding formats/languages.
