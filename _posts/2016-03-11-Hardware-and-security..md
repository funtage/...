**Hardware**

Input Peripherals(peripherals are things that make the computer work, or work better.):

Microphone,Camera,Scanner

Output Peripherals:

Speakers, Monitor, Printer.

Hard drive:

The hard drive is long term storage, it is made up of a disc made of metal, magnets, platters, a head, an actuator and an actuator arm. The hard drive stores memory even when the computer is turned off.

RAM:

RAM stands for random access memory, it is short term memory. The RAM stores information when the computer is on, but then it forgets it when it is turned off. It is made up of individual microchips.

CPU:

A CPU holds the instructions for the entire computer, it can be programmed to perform different functions. This makes different companies always wanting to make better CPUs that perform more functions than before. CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. The newest CPUs are named microprocessors, they are made up of one integrated circuit.

For a computer to perform quickly, all of the different parts need to be up to scratch. You could use the phrase 'a chain is only as good as its weakest link'.

**Security**

Malware can be downloaded onto your computer by pretending to be something else(trojan horse) or you might just spread onto a computer through a normal program. It might also come from another infected device(worm). A virus installs itself onto your computer through a regular program, it might slow down your device or it may delete things on your device. Worms spread onto your computer from another device. They copy themselves hundreds of times onto applications and such; they can harm lots in a short amount of time. Trojan horses pretend to be useful and/or safe programs, they then download themselves onto your machine and harm your computer. Spyware installs itself onto your device and then steals information such as passwords, postcodes or emails. It also sometimes uses your webcam! Information about you is often stored through a technique called key-logging, this records everything you type and then people can look through it and find key words or information about you. Botnets are groups of internet-connected computers that coordinate their actions to do things such as spam emails or messages  or anything malicious which could be easier or better on multiple devices. Viruses or trojan horses can often compromise whole computers! Causing the computer to become a 'zombie computer'. This can then be used to perform malicious tasks remotely, effectively using a ‘zombie computer’ to make another computer a ‘zombie computer’. Hence the name ‘zombie’.
