This lesson we had a whole lesson dedicated to making our blogs better. It was pretty easy, however there were a few hiccups. By the end of the lesson I had improved my blog however there is always more things I can add and improve, such as my font colour. 

Our teacher, Mr Tansley, decided that if we had a problem we should go to him and ask him. He would then tell us what to do and, in some cases, he would show us on his blog. This worked really well since he was making sure we were being independent while still teaching us. I improved my blog by adding a picture background, however I still need to make it scroll with the rest of the page and I changed the font. That might not sound like a lot however I struggled to change the background, then I made it not repeat and attempted to make it scroll with the page.

The only thing that might of wasted a bit of my time was when the teacher was helping someone fix their blog as it wasn't working and it wouldn't post. I sat there for a bit and watched them fix it, however I was still learning since now if I ever get that problem I can fix it myself.

Next time I will stick with my own work. However, as I said before, me listening in might not of been so bad. 

Overall, it was a progressive lesson and my blog is now a lot better than it was before. Possibly making me go up another grade.
