Last lesson, we began to make progress with our 'raspberry' computers. This instantly proved difficult for me and my partner, Finlay, as the cable was apparently snapped causing it to not fit inside the computer. After we, with the help of the teachers, had sorted the issue we started to code with the ‘basic’ language. We managed to save our progress onto memory sticks, with much difficulty, towards the end. We need to improve on our set up speed however it should be a lot quicker next time as the cable should be working properly.
