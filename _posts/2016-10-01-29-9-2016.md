In this lesson we continued to play around with the concept of variables. We are now starting to create our own images and make them move etc. This is fun but quite challenging, however if we read from the book we will be just fine. I think we could quite easily do most of the challenges right now if we followed the book however if it comes to us having to do something on our own, like a project, we will need a bit more practice.
