In this lesson we looked at an interactive online set of videos to help us understand about the dangers of the web and find out about think u know. This was very cool and helpful since we got to go through the same experience as all the other characters. For homework, we had to browse the think u know website. This was interesting since there were lots of other helpful videos on there too.
