Over the holidays, I attempted to work on my code and further the progress I had made in the lesson. In the lesson I had created the code to list the answers out in lists and look through them. However, after this I was completely stuck. I couldn't understand how to get the answers from the user, log them and turn them into a number I could count up and judge what the result was. I then went on to do different answer scripts, to see if it would get me anywhere since I felt I had dug myself into a hole. Every time I tried to restart I would get to the same position of not knowing how to log the answers. I know you have to use the input function, but I am not sure how or when to do so. I will have to ask the teacher about how to do this when I get back since I don't think, sadly, that I can figure it out on my own. I have tried but it stumps me every time. I also have looked online for help, however they are all for right and wrong scenarios, rather than the buzzfeed style quizzes we are meant to construct. Overall, this homework has got me completely stumped, and I can't really seem to figure out how or what to do.
